### Machine Learning With Python 

[Understand Travel Mode Choice, USA](https://hqiao97.github.io/travelmode/)

The project is to understand travel mode choice in the U.S. through using the 2017 National Household Travel Survey and vairous data visualziation techniques. Besides, we used different machine learning methods to predict travel mode choice along with socio-economic characteristics, trip characteristics and land-use characteristics.

### Machine Learning With R 

[A Fire Response Situational Awareness API, Philadelphia](/content/Fire_Response_Situational_Awareness_API.html)

The project is intended to present the methodology of an analysis of property fire risk in Philadelphia and an API tool that aims to improve the fire departmentâ€™s situational awareness. This new API tool can provide real-time information and assessment for all parcels in the city.

[Train occupancy prediction, Belgium](/content/occupancy_prediction.html)

In this project, we built multinomial logit models to spatially predict the occupancy levels of Belgian. Specifically, the spatial network of the trains was analyzed to select the OD pairs and train lines with certain characteristics of occupancy levels to increase accuracy but ensure generalizability.Cost-benefit analysis was used to adjust the model. 
The final model has a relatively high total accuracy of 0.7 and a satisfying generalizability.

We also designed a website called SmartOccupancy with 3 main functions to help transportation planners rebalance train services provision and maximize the profit. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8b7DR42uhw">Check out the video here</a>

[Space-Time Prediction of Bike Share Demand, Philadelphia](/content/Zirui_Chen_Bikeshare_Predict.html)

In this project, I use the Indego bike share data along with other related dataset including weather and census data. OLS models were trained to predict bike-share demand in space-time.
The final model has relatively low MAE. The generalizability of the model was also analyzed.
